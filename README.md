The BigInt project leverages fundamental DSA concepts such as dynamic arrays (vectors), string manipulation, and efficient algorithms for basic arithmetic operations. This not only helps in managing large numbers but also provides a solid practice ground for implementing and understanding these fundamental DSA principles in C++.
